    Inspired in part by the above interstitial track off of Johnny Foreigner's 2012 album "Johnny Foreigner vs Everything", and by my work on digital possessions and connections after a break-up, this project tackles core questions, including:

    <ol>
      <li>What is a better definition of what a digital possession is?</li>
      <li>What is the connection between digital possessions and the memories and emotions one experienced during and after a break-up?</li>
    </ol>
